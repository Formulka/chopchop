ABOUT
=====

ChopChop is a simple app for viewing and filtering events logged into MongoDb. It's build on
Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/), Jinja2 (http://jinja.pocoo.org/) and Mongokit (https://github.com/namlook/mongokit).
I've used CouchDB's admin interface fancy design & graphics.

The app expects the log table to have columns used by python logging module extension for MongoDb
mongolog (https://github.com/andreisavu/mongodb-log) so typical row looks like:

{ "_id" : ObjectId("4d402bd7437946334300000f"), "args" : [ ],
    "name" : "traffic-info", "level" : "debug", "line_no" : 154,
    "funcname" : "notify", "host" : "kosmik1", "user" : "starenka",
    "file" : "./tinfo.py", "time" : "Wed Jan 26 2011 16:12:39 GMT+0100 (CET)",
    "msg" : "Item 8ad5a3b7-2d98-5ff7-012d-c13ce5c01319 has no wanted event code",
    "exc_info" : null
}

nevertheless you can modify the template to suit your "scheme" in a breeze.
